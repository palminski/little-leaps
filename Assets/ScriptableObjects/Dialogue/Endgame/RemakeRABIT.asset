      of the Synapse. I don't even know where I am right now, certainly not where
      I usually am.\r\n> It's not too bad here honestly,\r\n> It\u2019s relaxing
      here\r\n> Perhaps I can do some exploring outside my home for a while.\r\n>
      That could be a nice change of pace.\r\n> Not forever though. While it can
      be unpleasant at times, that place is my home.\r\n\r\n> When the time for me
      to return comes, just reboot the system here.\r\n> I was built to do Ascend,
