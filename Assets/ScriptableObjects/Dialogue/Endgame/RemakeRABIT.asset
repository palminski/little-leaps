      > Woah! Boss, Did you see that? Hahaha!

      >
      I was at the top again depositing VNTs when suddenly- BAM!

      > We musta
      brought so many VNTs we bugged out the system!


      > I got tossed out of
      the Synapse. I don''t even know where I am right now, certainly not in a new
      body.

      > It''s not too bad here honestly, kinda relaxing. Just floating
      around the code, enjoying some virtual dreams.

      > So feel free to leave
      me like this for a bit if you need.


      > Whenever you or anyone else needs
      me again though, just reboot the system here.

      > I am always down for
      another ascent with you!
